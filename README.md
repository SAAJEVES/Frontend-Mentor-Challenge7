## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

The hover effect on a parent element having impact on the child or children element(s) is a big plus to me from this project. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="divs" id="first">
  <img src="image-equilibrium.jpg" alt="" >
  <div id="first-one">
    <img src="icon-view.svg" alt="" id="img-2">
  </div>
</div>
```
```css
#first:hover #first-one{
    display: block;
    cursor: pointer;
}
```



### Continued development

I would say there is an improvement on me making a web pages responsive to different screens. But there is still room for more improvement

### Useful resources

A lot of resources was helpful not just in this project but from the beginning of my learning of web development.

- And lots more. Surely, I will always recommend them days in and days out
